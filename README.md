  - must support latest browser versions and IE11
  - must pass the [lighthouse check](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)

### Languages, Libraries, Frameworks, Tools
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Dependencies
- `react` via `react-create-app` and all packages coming with it

### Dev Dependencies
- `gh-pages`
  - to host the project on GitHub Pages
  - for that also this is needed in the `package.json`
    - `"homepage": "https://ellypirelly.github.io/cf-meet",`
    - `"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"`
  -

### How to run this?
- clone the repo
- `cd` into project
- `npm install`
- run to start the server
  - `npm run start`
  - this is going to start a local server on `http://localhost:3000/`
- run to deploy the project to the `gh-pages` branch
  - `npm run deploy`
- run to predeploy the project
  - `"predeploy": "npm run build",`
  - is necessary as sometimes the `build` folder does not contain the latest changes from the app
  - as you most likely want the latest build deployed on GitHub Pages, running this might come in handy
